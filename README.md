## Restaurant order app

This app is supposed to help with taking orders from customers. It was built using the React library, Typescript and Redux Toolkit. It was my first time using Typescript, so I used a video as a guide. This was also a great practice to use Redux one more time! It is a small project, but Redux is a very important tool for the overall management of a React app, and I wanted to give it a go. I also used a tool uuid to manage the ids for every customer.

It's a very simple app with little to no style (I wanted to focus on Typescript and Redux), you will see a reservation section where you should add the name of the customer. After you add the name, you can click on it, and it will automatically go to the right section of the page where you can add the food that the client is asking for.
